# Coding Challenge 

This repository presents a series of coding challenges aimed at improving programming skills. Each challenge offers a distinct problem statement alongside a solution initially developed for command line interfaces (CLI). Over time, solutions are evolved by incorporating graphical user interfaces (GUI) for enhanced user interaction. Furthermore, the adoption of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodologies is used, given suitability for addressing various problems through a class-based approach.
