# Speed Tracker

Speed Tracker is a Python program designed to monitor and track vehicles passing through two speed cameras. It calculates the average speed of vehicles between two cameras and identifies vehicles exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, it validates the number plates of the vehicles to ensure they match a specific pattern.

## Features

- **Data Generation**: Random data generation for testing purposes including car types, number plates, and timestamps of passing through cameras.
- **Number Plate Validation**: Validates number plates based on a specific pattern.
- **Speeding Violations Detection**: Identifies vehicles exceeding the speed limit between two cameras.
- **Output Generation**: Updates the CSV file with a new column indicating whether each number plate is valid and generates a list of vehicles exceeding the speed limit.
