# Triangulate

This Python program provides functionality to analyse and classify a triangle based on its side lengths. It also offers the capability to calculate the length of a missing side given certain inputs.

## Features

- **Input Triangle Dimensions:** Collects lengths for all three sides of a triangle from the user.
- **Validate Triangle:** Checks if the provided side lengths form a valid triangle.
- **Classify Triangle:** Determines the type of triangle based on its side lengths:
  - Equilateral
  - Isosceles
  - Scalene
  - Right-Angle (including Isosceles Right-Angle)
- **Calculate Missing Side:** Computes the length of a missing side using the Law of Cosines if additional inputs (angle and two sides) are provided.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
   Execute the script using a Python interpreter. The program will prompt you to enter the lengths of the three sides of your triangle.

2. **Input Side Lengths:**
   Provide positive numerical values for the three sides. If invalid inputs are given, the program will prompt you to re-enter the values.

3. **Validate Triangle:**
   The program checks if the given side lengths form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem.

4. **Classify Triangle:**
   Based on the side lengths, the program will classify the triangle into one of the following types:
   - Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
   - Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
   - Scalene: All sides are different.
   - Right-Angle: The triangle has a right angle, with a special case for Isosceles Right-Angle triangles.

5. **Calculate Missing Side (Optional):**
   If the triangle is not equilateral, you can choose to calculate a missing side if you provide an angle and the lengths of two sides. The program uses the Law of Cosines for this calculation.

## Example

```
Please enter the lengths of the three sides of your triangle:
Length of side 1: 3
Length of side 2: 4
Length of side 3: 5
With lengths: [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
This is a Right-Angle triangle.
```

If the triangle is not equilateral, you can also perform additional calculations:

```
Please enter the angle in degrees: 90
Please enter the length of the first side: 3
Please enter the length of the second side: 4
The length of the missing side is: 5.00
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (`math`)
